MCAuth
======

MCAuth is an alternative to the Minecraft.net user authentication system. It supports the legacy authentication (pre-1.6) and the new Yggdrasil authentication. It can optionally contact minecraft.net for unknown logins, skins, and capes. This compliments MineProxy and my modified Technic Launcher both of which can proxy Minecraft to this service.
