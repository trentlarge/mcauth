MCAuth
======

This is an alternative to the Minecraft.net user authentication system.  It is similar to services such as Mineshafter, but this version can also check Minecraft.net to get skins, capes, or to authenticate an unknown user.  This compliments my modified Technic Launcher that can authenticate with and proxy Minecraft to this clone.
